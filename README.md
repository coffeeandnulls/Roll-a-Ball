# 🌀 Roll A Ball – My First Unity Game

Welcome to my very first Unity project!  
This simple game was built as part of my journey to learn game development from scratch.

## 🎮 About the Game

In **Roll A Ball**, you control a ball that collects spinning cubes.  
Each time a cube is collected, your score increases.  
When all the cubes are collected, the game ends and can be restarted with **R**.

- 3D Physics-based movement
- Basic score system with UI Toolkit
- Restart functionality

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Unity Physics & Rigidbody
- Input System
- UI Toolkit basics
- Scene management and scripting fundamentals
